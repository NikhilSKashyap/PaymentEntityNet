# PaymentEntityNet

## Overview

PaymentEntityNet is an advanced machine learning project designed to analyze and generate embeddings for payment entities such as merchants, issuers, and customers. The project utilizes a hybrid architecture combining transformer-based sequence modeling with graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture both temporal transaction patterns and complex entity relationships.

## Technical Details

### Data Processing

The project uses a synthetic credit card transaction dataset, simulating real-world payment data. Key features include:

- Time-based features
- Anonymized transaction characteristics (V1-V28)
- Transaction amount
- Fraud classification
- Synthetic merchant and issuer IDs

Data preprocessing involves:
1. Normalization of numerical features
2. Creation of synthetic entity relationships
3. Preparation of data for graph-based learning

### Model Architecture

PaymentEntityNet employs a hybrid architecture:

1. **Transformer-based Sequence Modeling**: 
   - Utilizes a modified BERT-like architecture
   - Processes chronological sequences of transactions
   - Captures temporal patterns and contextual relationships

2. **Graph Neural Network (GraphSAGE)**:
   - Aggregates information from entity neighborhoods
   - Captures structural relationships between merchants, issuers, and customers

3. **Fusion Layer**:
   - Combines embeddings from both transformer and GNN components
   - Produces final entity embeddings

### Training Process

The model is trained using a multi-task learning approach:
- Fraud detection as a binary classification task
- Entity embedding generation through contrastive learning

Optimization is performed using Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.

### Inference

During inference, the model generates fixed-length embeddings for entities, which can be used for:
- Fraud detection
- Customer segmentation
- Merchant risk assessment
- Personalized service recommendations

```
python train/train.py
```

This script will:
1. Load and prepare the data
2. Initialize the PaymentNet model
3. Train the model using both transaction sequences and entity relationships
4. Save the trained model

### Generating Embeddings

```
python inference/generate_embeddings.py
```

This script demonstrates how to:
1. Load a trained model
2. Process new data
3. Generate embeddings for entities

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for fraud detection
- Embedding quality assessment through downstream tasks

## Future Enhancements

1. **Federated Learning**: Implement privacy-preserving training across multiple data sources.

2. **Dynamic Graph Learning**: Extend the GNN to handle dynamic, temporal graphs for evolving entity relationships.

3. **Multi-modal Input**: Incorporate additional data types such as text descriptions or images for richer entity representations.

4. **Attention Mechanisms**: Implement self-attention in the GNN to better capture important entity interactions.

5. **Explainable AI**: Develop techniques to interpret the model's decisions, crucial for applications in the financial sector.

6. **Real-time Learning**: Implement online learning components to adapt to concept drift in transaction patterns.

7. **Scalability**: Optimize for large-scale deployment, possibly using distributed training and inference.

8. **Adversarial Robustness**: Enhance the model's resilience against adversarial attacks, critical for fraud detection applications.

9. **Transfer Learning**: Explore pre-training on large-scale financial datasets for improved performance on specific tasks.

10. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models or architectures for more robust predictions.
